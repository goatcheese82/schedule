# Overview

This application is a demonstration of my abilities working with APIs using Golang

This application is a REST API that will be used to schedule tasks for people who have a hard time with routines. It uses Golang, Gin Gonic, PGX and PostGRESql to create a fast and responsive interface.

This software was written in part to improve my skills using the Golang language, but mostly this was written so I can stay on track during the day.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
